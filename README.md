# AI-Agent-PromptChaining

Prompt Chaining is an effective method for building AI agents by breaking down complex tasks into multiple sequential prompts.

1. Define the Goal and Break Down the Task

- Set the Goal: Clearly define what the AI agent should achieve. For example, "Create an agent that summarizes user questions and provides recommendations."

- Task Decomposition: Divide the goal into smaller, manageable steps. Each step should be independent yet connect to the next. Example:
  - Analyze input data
  - Summarize key information
  - Generate recommendations based on the summary
  - Format the final output
