# AI-Agent-PromptChaining

Prompt Chaining is an effective method for building AI agents by breaking down complex tasks into multiple sequential prompts.

1. Define the Goal and Break Down the Task

- Set the Goal: Clearly define what the AI agent should achieve. For example, "Create an agent that summarizes user questions and provides recommendations."

- Task Decomposition: Divide the goal into smaller, manageable steps. Each step should be independent yet connect to the next. Example:
  - Analyze input data
  - Summarize key information
  - Generate recommendations based on the summary
  - Format the final output

2. Design Prompts for Each Step
   Craft clear and specific prompts for each step to guide the AI toward the desired output. Here’s an example:

Example: Question Summarization and Recommendation Agent

    - Step 1: Input Analysis

        You are an AI that analyzes user questions. Identify the main topic and requirements from the following question. Summarize the results in a concise sentence.
        Question: "{user input}"
        Output format: Main topic: [topic], Requirements: [requirements]

    - Step 2: Summarization

        Based on the main topic and requirements identified in the previous step, summarize the information concisely.
        Input: Main topic: [topic], Requirements: [requirements]
        Output format: Summary: [concise summary]

    - Step 3: Recommendation Generation

        Using the summarized information, generate appropriate recommendations for the user. Recommendations should be specific and actionable.
        Input: Summary: [concise summary]
        Output format: Recommendations: [recommendation content]

    - Step 4: Final Output

        Combine the summary and recommendations to provide a friendly and clear response to the user.
        Input: Summary: [summary], Recommendations: [recommendations]
        Output format:
        Hello! Based on your question, here’s a summary: [summary]. I recommend the following: [recommendations]. Let me know if you have more questions!

3. Chain the Prompts

   - Sequential Execution: Use the output of each step as the input for the next. For example, Step 1’s output (main topic and requirements) feeds into Step 2.

   - Context Preservation: Ensure prompts include or reference prior step outputs to maintain continuity. Store intermediate results if needed.

   - Conditional Branching: Add logic to redirect to different prompts based on conditions, e.g., "If the question is unclear, generate a clarifying question."

4. Test and Optimize
   - Testing: Run the prompt chain with various inputs to verify results. Check if each step produces expected outputs and if the chain flows smoothly.

-Optimization: - Clarity: Keep prompts concise and unambiguous to avoid confusing the AI.

    - Error Handling: Include instructions for handling invalid inputs or unexpected outputs, e.g., "If input is insufficient, note it and request more details."

    - Feedback Loop: Refine prompts based on user feedback or test outcomes.

Example: Workflow in Action

User Input: "Recommend fun things to do in Charlotte this weekend."
